## **ðŸ“Œ Project Flow**

InvestorIntel operates through a sophisticated multi-agent system that serves both startup founders and investors through different login interfaces:

### **Startup Founder Interface**
Startup founders can upload their pitch decks along with essential details including:
- Startup name
- Industry category
- LinkedIn URLs
- Website URL

Once uploaded, the pitch deck is securely stored in Amazon S3, triggering the InvestorIntel analysis pipeline.

### **Investor Interface**
When investors log in, the LangGraph-powered multi-agent system activates, providing comprehensive startup analysis through five specialized agents:

#### **1. Summary Agent**
- Extracts critical information from uploaded pitch decks
- Generates concise, structured summaries of the startup's value proposition
- Stores these summaries in Pinecone for rapid retrieval

#### **2. Competitor Analysis Agent**
- Provides visual graphs and detailed summaries of competitors in the same industry
- Sources competitor data from Growjo and Crunchbase
- Fetches structured competitive intelligence from Snowflake databases

#### **3. Industry Analysis Agent**
- Analyzes McKinsey Industry Reports (pre-loaded PDFs)
- Delivers industry-level insights and trend analysis
- Stores and indexes this data in both Snowflake and Pinecone for contextual retrieval

#### **4. Web Search Agent**
- Gathers live news and web trends via MCP Server custom query
- Enhances trend insights and competitor monitoring
- Provides real-time market intelligence to supplement stored data

#### **5. Q&A Bot**
- Leverages Pinecone vector database for retrieving contextual information
- Allows investors to ask specific questions about the startup
- Implements a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline for accurate responses

This integrated workflow enables investors to perform thorough due diligence on startups with AI-powered intelligence, saving time and improving decision quality.
